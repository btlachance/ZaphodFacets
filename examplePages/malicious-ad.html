  <h1>Advertising example</h1>
  <p>
  Money makes the world go round, and advertising powers the web.
  There are lots of varieties of advertising used,
  but JavaScript-powered ads have become the norm.
  </p>
  <p>
  Google's AdSense is one example.
  Google is a trusted, respected name.
  Instinctively, people will not be suspicious of a link like the following:
  </p>

<div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<!-- Add (fake) Google +1 button to render -->
<span id='plusone'></span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span>Like my story!!!</span>
</div>

  <p>
  But the advertising code is not really coming from Google.
  In fact, this comes from a third-party site,
  but with a little obfuscation/minimization might very well
  <a id='nytimes-link' href='http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/15/technology/internet/15adco.html'
     > pass by reviewers undetected</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  But this advertiser is not so trustworthy now.
  If you click on this page,
  an attempt was made to redirect you to a 'malicious' site.
  Try running this page with SpiderMonkey enabled,
  and then rerun with the Zaphod engine enabled.
  </p>

  <p>
  With <a href='https://github.com/taustin/ZaphodFacets'>Zaphod w/ Faceted Values</a>,
  we run all code using the dom.js DOM,
  but we can monitor mutation events before they hit the underlying host DOM.
  </p>

<!-- Load advertiser code -->
<script type="application/javascript" src='ad.js'>
</script>
<!-- malicous code -->
<script type="application/javascript" src='http://localhost/infoflow/clickjack.js'>
</script>

  <p>
  <strong>Be sure that the modified version of Zaphod is installed and active.</strong>
  You should see a small, red mozilla logo at the bottom right of your browser.
